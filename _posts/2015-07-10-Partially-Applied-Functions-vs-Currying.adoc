= Partially Applied Functions vs Currying
:hp-tags: scala, functional programming
As new to functional programming and Scala, I found it challenging to understand what Partially Applied Functions, Currying and Partial Functions are. I decided to take it slow and let the concept sink in before I make any progress since they are some of the building blocks for writing better, cleaner functional code. And since they are used everywhere in Scala, learning them would give a better velocity when writing code.
